# Continual_Learning_Bibliogaphies_Bibtex2Md
Automatic script to parse bibtex to mardown to create manageable bibliography github repository. We take the example of continual learning to illustrate the script.



## Run the classification

```
# python 2.x or 3.x
# it is assumed that you use the file "bibtex.bib"
python bibtex_to_md.py
```

## Modify the script

The script is only searching for keywords in bibtex attributs' entries. Then, to modify you can modify the keywords, the attributs to evaluate or the bibtex.
We use also simple functions to plot categories titles.
